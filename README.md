Functional Programming Primer
===

I decided to prepare an introduction talk for the topic of functional programming.
As such it should roughly introduce some concepts typical for the programming style
and discuss them to provide reasoning and perspective around them.

Outline
---
I figured that the talk should touch upon these topics:

* A few words on lisp and AST
* Freedom from state
  * State as the problem
  * How OOP deals with state
  * How FP deals with state
* Mathematical definition of functions
  * Soo pure
  * map filter reduce
  * Currying
  * compositon and associativity
* A word on Patterns
  * OOP has patterns - what are they?
  * Where did my patterns go?
* Typechecking
* Evaluation strategies and rewriting
  * Fibonacci
* Outro
  * How did I stumble upon FP?
  * How did FP change the way I approach programming?
  * Further reading
